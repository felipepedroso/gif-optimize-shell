# About
This is a small script that was created to help with the process of uploading images to my PRs on Github.

Thanks a lot [@makaroffandrey](https://github.com/makaroffandrey) for pointing me the proper `ffmpeg` command to do the gif optimization.

# Usage
```
gif-optimize.sh [-f|--fps=<fps>] [-s|--scale=<scale>] <file-path|directory-path>
```

Note: Please install [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) CLI before start using this script.
